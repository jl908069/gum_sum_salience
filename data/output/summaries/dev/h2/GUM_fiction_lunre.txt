The narrator describes when their new tutor, Master Lunre, an Olondrian that their father is bringing, arrived in Tyom; the way the villagers flocked to witness him, looking at him with confusion and calling him "a yellow man"; a memory of the last time they saw an Olondrian "yellow man", a wizard doctor who had left the island; and how Master Lunre is old and strange-looking.
