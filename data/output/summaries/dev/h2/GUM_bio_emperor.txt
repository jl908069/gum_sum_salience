Joshua Abraham Norton (c. 1818-January 8, 1880), also known as Emperor Norton, was a resident of San Francisco who lost his fortune in Peruvian rice but was still celebrated by other citizens of San Francisco for his regal presence and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge and tunnel connecting San Francisco to Oakland.
