In 2016, the National Library of the Netherlands and the University Library of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam joined forces to develop a set of clinics on DH for librarians in order to teach librarians the ins and outs of DH in order for them to take up their natural role of facilitating and supporting research and ideally become the research partner needed in DH projects.
