Byron was an English poet in the early 1800s who had relationships with younger boys during his time at the Harrow school and Trinity College in Cambridge during a time in England where being convicted of suspected of homosexuality could have resulted in consequences as serious as public hanging, which are chronicled in his poems such as Childish Recollections and Thyrza.
