Before reviewing the results of six similar studies, this paper presents a study that examines if a substantial period of no exposure following second language (L2) training leads to decreased proficiency and/or less native-like processes in adult learners, as well as if the outcome is influenced by classroom-like versus immersion-like contexts.
