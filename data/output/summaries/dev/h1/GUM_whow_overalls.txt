This guide to washing overalls suggests washing them with like clothing, avoiding clothes which can get twisted up with the straps, fastening straps to the bib with twist ties (also in the dryer), emptying pockets, moving the strap adjusters to make them last longer, using less detergent if washing overalls alone, and taking care plastic ties don't melt in the dryer.
