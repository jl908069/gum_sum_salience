Athens, the capital city of Greece, has a long and still developing history, stretching from the first pre-historic settlements of Old Athens, to the hosting of the modern Summer Olympic games of 2004, to the present day city, which has continued to expand and now boasts both historic neoclassical buildings and post-modern buildings.
