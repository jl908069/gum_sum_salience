This study tests the effect of limited exposure to second language after training on the neurocognition of L2 grammar in adult learners and describes previous studies on this topic that showed that in some cases limited exposure leads to attrition of L2 knowledge, but in other cases, there is either no attrition or even a gain in L2 performance.
