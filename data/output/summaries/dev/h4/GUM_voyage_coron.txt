Coron, the largest town on Busuanga Island in the Palawan province of the Philippines, is the ancestral home of the Tagbanuas, an indigenous tribe of nomadic, seafaring people, but it is now better known as a tourist destination famous for its World War II wreck diving, white sand beaches, and ideal locations for snorkeling and scuba diving.
