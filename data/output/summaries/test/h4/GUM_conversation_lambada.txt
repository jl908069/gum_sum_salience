A man ask his friends, Harold and Miles, about going out to dance, but then Miles tells a story about when he went out a few weeks ago and saw a woman who was first dancing suggestively with a middle-aged man and then didn’t dance with him again and instead hooked up with other men at the club, and after this story they say that maybe they shouldn’t go dancing after all.
