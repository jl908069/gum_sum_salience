Gújjolaay Eegimaa is a language spoken in the Basse Casamance area, specifically Mof-Ávvi, of Southern Senegal by around 10,000 speakers, though the language is endangered as people are not sharing it with younger generations; some of the Eegimaa death prevention names and child - bearing names are given to Eegimaa people from other communities.
