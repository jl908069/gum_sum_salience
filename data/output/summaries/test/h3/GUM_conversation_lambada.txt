Miles recounts some of his experiences dancing to friends Jamie and Harold, recounting in particular a time when a woman he went with did not want to dance and was approached by multiple men, and another time in which he saw an attractive woman dancing suggestively with a man in his fifties, and then later saw that woman talking and kissing another random guy.
