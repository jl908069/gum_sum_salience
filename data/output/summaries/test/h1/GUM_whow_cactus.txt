This guide explains how to grow Beavertail cactus, either from seeds in a shady garden in moist soil, leading to flowers in 4 years, or more quickly from cuttings, 6 months or older, cured in dry shade for 10-14 days, then planted upright in pots with drainage holes in the sun, watering after a month and letting soil dry, as well as fertilizing in spring, summer and fall.
