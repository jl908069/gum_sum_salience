To grow the Beavertail Cactus, there are two primary methods, which include scattering the seeds in a shaded bed for slower growth or planting your own cuttings from a previously owned cactus in a soil and sand mixture and place in direct sunlight, while ensuring the roots are not oversaturated with water in the first month and that the cactus receives a balanced fertilizer.
