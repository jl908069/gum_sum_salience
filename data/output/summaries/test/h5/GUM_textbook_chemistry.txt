This section of a textbook describes postulates of John Daltonâ€™s 1807 atomic theory: matter is composed of atoms, each element consists of only one type of atom, atoms of one element are different from atoms of all other elements, compounds are made of atoms of two or more elements in whole number ratios, and atoms are neither created nor destroyed during a chemical change.
