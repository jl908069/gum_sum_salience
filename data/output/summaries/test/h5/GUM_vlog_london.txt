Two years after moving in, Kharma Medic proudly gives viewers a tour of his room in London due to popular request, and he shows viewers various things, like the bed and couch area, the small balcony, the color-matched pictures on the wall, his storage spaces and clothing, the floor-to-ceiling windows, and the posters that he bought back in 2013 as a university student.
