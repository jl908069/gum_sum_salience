Researchers used an artificial tail to study the effects of a more vertically oriented femur on the locomotion of chickens, finding that the change in femur orientation was associated with a more hip-driven gait and reduced bending and torsional moments, suggesting that non-avian dinosaurs may have had similar limb postures and kinematics.
