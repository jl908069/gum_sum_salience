The Texas War for Independence, also known as the Texas Revolution, began in the early 1830s with growing tensions between American settlers and the Mexican government over issues such as immigration, land ownership, and slavery, ultimately leading to the outbreak of war in 1835 and the eventual independence of Texas in 1836, following the famous Battle of the Alamo.
