This section of a ballet dancing guide explains some of ballet's history and popularity and gives practical advice on stretching before and after dancing, wearing properly fitted slippers or else socks without stickies on the bottom, wearing snug comfortable clothes such as a leotard and tights, and finding space to practice, ideally in a studio with a barre.
