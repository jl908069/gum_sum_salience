This guide gives instructions for 'hypnotizing' a chicken, by holding it with one hand with its breast on a flat surface and its legs held back, and then wiggling a finger from above the tip of its beak to its back or drawing a line before its beak until it stops squawking, resulting in a temporary attempt to 'play dead', which can be ended by clapping hands.
