This basil growing guide recommends varieties (Cinnamon, Lemon, Purple, African Blue or Thai Basil), planting seed in containers with perlite, vermiculite, peat and soil before transfering sprouts to bigger containers or a garden, watering each morning and removing flower buds before plants bolt, and finally using basil for salads and pesto and freezing basil puree.
