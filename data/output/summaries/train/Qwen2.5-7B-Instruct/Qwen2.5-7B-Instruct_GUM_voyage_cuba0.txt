Most nationalities require a 15-25 CUC visa card for 30 days, extendable once, while Canadians get a 90-day visa on arrival, both obtainable through embassies, consulates, or online; a 25 CUC departure tax is mandatory in cash, and travelers need proof of funds and return tickets; US dollars are no longer accepted, only Cuban convertible pesos (CUC).
