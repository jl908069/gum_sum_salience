Saint Jerome, a Latin Catholic priest born around 347 AD, is renowned for translating the Bible into Latin (the Vulgate). A prominent theologian, he advocated for Christian moral life, especially for women, through connections with female ascetics. Converted after studies in Rome, Jerome lived an ascetic life, focusing on theological studies and Hebrew learning.
