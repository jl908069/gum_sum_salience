After an artillery exchange, North Korea put its military on high alert and in a "quasi-state of war." Kim Jong-un ordered the army to prepare for battle over South Korea's propaganda broadcasts, which North Korea claims are a grave provocation. North Korea has threatened military retaliation if the broadcasts don't stop within 48 hours.
