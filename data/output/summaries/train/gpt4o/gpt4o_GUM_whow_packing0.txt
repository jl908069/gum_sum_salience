Organize packing by room and item frequency using sturdy, appropriately-sized boxes. Securely tape and label, especially fragile items. Create a first-night essentials box, balance heavy/light items, use discreet labels for valuables, get free boxes from stores, and purchase extras if needed. Document, declutter, and designate a space for packed boxes at home.
