Einstein's theory describes gravity as the warping of spacetime by massive objects, contrasting with Newton's gravitational force. This curvature affects the paths of light and stars, similar to a rubber sheet distorted by weights. This concept has practical applications, such as the necessary corrections in GPS systems due to the effects of spacetime warping.
