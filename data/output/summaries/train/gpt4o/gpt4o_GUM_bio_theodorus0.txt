Initially denied authority due to his wealth, Theodorus of Tabennese became a key figure in stabilizing the Koinonia monastic federation after a leadership crisis. He acted as a peacemaker among rebellious monks and led the community effectively for eighteen years. Before his death, he predicted his passing and peacefully returned authority to Horsiesios.
