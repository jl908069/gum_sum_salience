To create a made-up language, start by naming it and choosing basic words. Establish grammar, possibly inspired by real languages, and use non-Latin characters if desired. Document the language and practice regularly to gain fluency. Be creative but avoid gibberish, and consider expanding it to books or teaching friends and family.
